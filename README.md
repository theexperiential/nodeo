#### :film_projector: Why we are building this
We designed nodeo to be a simple interactive playback solution for livestreams, permanent installations and events. The aim is stable, aesthetic and customizable 24/7 delivery of TouchDesigner components, movies and Notch blocks to external displays and/or apps/platforms (such as OBS/Twitch) via NDI. 

The name is a combination of *node* and *video,* as a good share of generative artwork is created in node-based environments.

#### :book: How to use

Download or clone the entire repo. Inside of the [server](/server) folder is the nodeo main toe file. Open it on a reasonably powerful computer. (Windows i7 / GTX 1080 eq. or better Desktop is recommended)

### :mailbox_with_mail: Releases

### 2021.0.8

* Updated Engine COMP Implementation to better support the new 2021 TD release.

#### 2020.5.246

* Duration handling improvements
* Minor bug fixes

#### 2020.5.227
* Overhauled Engine + composite system so it is separately threaded from the UI. This greatly improves performance and enables UI interactions without impacting NDI output frame rates.
* Many minor bug fixes
* Various minor improvements
* Blackout button improved (thanks @drmbt)
* Audio options expanded (thanks @drmbt)

#### 2020.2.2180
* Initial public release

### :sparkle: System Outline
(*) = *on the roadmap but not implemented yet* \
(**) = *in progress*
	
#### I. 	Nodeo acts as a train.

It has four engine (COMP) cars.

Each Engine is composed of a rotor (Base COMP) that processes video,
and a separate Snd Base COMP that processes audio.

An Engineer (Base COMP) drives the train.

#### II. Segments act as train cars.

Each carries a temporal fragments of a type of media.

Segment Types/Sub-types:
1. Video (Scene)
    a. Generative (tox and dfx*)
    b. Movie (mov**)
    c. Stream** (NDI)
2. Transition
    a. Generative (tox and dfx*)
    b. Movie (mov**)
3. Audio (wav, aiff and stream) 
4. Text*
    
#### III. A Segment Cycle acts as triad of connected train cars.

Three segments make up a Segment Cycle:
Video (Gen/Mov/Stream), Transition (Gen/Mov), and Audio.

Each row in a Playlist is considered a Segment Cycle.

#### IV. An Active Playlist acts as Conductor of the train.

You may switch the Active Playlist by pulsing the Activate button 
(a small white play button directly to the right of the playlist tabs). 

Segments may also be made Active to an Engine by dragging and dropping
them onto an Engine Preview, from either a Playlist source or Media source.
